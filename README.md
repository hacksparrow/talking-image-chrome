Talking Image Chrome Extension
====================

The Talking Image Chrome extension will detect "talking images" (a term for images with appended audio data) and play the audio automatically.
The extension is based on the [Talking Image](https://github.com/hacksparrow/talking-image) JavaScript library.

##Example Images

Install the extension from [Google Store](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/talking-image/fbfmcblhmlkgghbhligndabjfmmhleke) and load the following images.
